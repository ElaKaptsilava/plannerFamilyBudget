After reviewing your monthly budget plan, here are some insights and recommendations:

1. **Wants:** You have allocated 40% of your budget towards wants, and your current progress is at 60.15%. It's great that you are within the wants limit, indicating that you are managing your discretionary expenses effectively.

2. **Needs:** 40% of your budget is designated for needs, but your current progress is at 140.13%, which is a danger sign. It seems like your expenses for needs are exceeding the allocated budget. I recommend reviewing your needs expenses and identifying areas where you can cut back to stay within your budget.

3. **Savings:** While you have allocated 20% of your budget towards savings, it appears that you have not managed to save any amount this month. It's essential to prioritize building up your savings for future financial security and unexpected expenses.

4. **Total Income and Expenses:** Your total monthly income is $15,229, and your total expenses amount to $9,760. You are left with $2,440 for running costs after accounting for both want and need expenses.

To improve your budgeting, consider the following actions:
- Review and potentially reduce your expenses in the needs category to align with the allocated budget.
- Find ways to increase your savings amount each month, even if it means making small adjustments to your wants and needs spending.

It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your budget to ensure financial stability and reach your financial goals. If you need further assistance in optimizing your budget or creating a financial plan, feel free to reach out.
